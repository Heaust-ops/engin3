# What is it?

## A ThreeJs Engine

This is an under development ThreeJs editor inspired Game engine

# What for?

## Making CG Websites blazing fast

I plan to load this things with lots of presets.
So I just have to code once and then I or anyone can use this engine to reimplement them easily in diverse environments.

# What will the code generation look like

## Human like

The code generation is planned to be very human like, so that once we the engine generates the code, it is possible for developers to further work on it and have a pleasant experience while doing so.

# Is it done?

## Nope

Not even close, But you can follow it's progress right here on this repo.
